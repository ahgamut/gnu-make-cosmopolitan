An experimental version of GNU Make with modifications to the source code so
that it compiles with Cosmopolitan Libc.

Clone the repo and run `superconfigure` to get `make.com.dbg` and `make.com`.

Current issues: `make.com -j4` does not work, which fails a bunch of tests.

GNU Make source code downloaded from: http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/make-4.3.tar.gz
